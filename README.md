How do I setup FerretCMS?
--------------
Once downloaded, place all files in your webservers root directory.
Then open up config.php and change the <code>DB_HOST</code>, <code>DB_USERNAME</code>,<code>DB_PASSWORD</code> and <code>SITE_ROOT</code> if necessary.

Once that setup is complete, visit the admin.php page in your web browser and the database / tables will build themselves.

Also be sure to update the "RewriteBase" and "ErrorDocument" items on the .htaccess file to match your current setup.
