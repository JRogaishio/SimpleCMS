twitchCMS
=========

A simple content management system built in PHP

Once downloaded, place all files in your webservers root directory.
Then open up config.php and change the DB_HOST, DB_USERNAME,DB_PASSWORD and SITE_ROOT if necessary.

Once that setup is complete, visit the admin.php page in your web browser and the database / tables will build themselves.
